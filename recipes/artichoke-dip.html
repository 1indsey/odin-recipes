<h3>An easy and delicious party favorite </h3>
<p>This Spinach & Artichoke dip is insanely easy and delicious. It's always my go-to for potlucks or
    appetizers for parties - guests always rave about it and I've been requested
    to make it on multiple occasions. Watch out, though...it's impossible to just have
    a few bites.
